 The Problem  The pharmaceutical industry faces significant challenges in monitoring and tracking the distribution of medical supplies. Regulatory authorities struggle to identify unauthorized importers and counterfeit manufacturers, leading to an increase in substandard pharmaceutical products. Traditional record-keeping methods are prone to manipulation, making it difficult to enforce compliance and ensure product authenticity.  Moreover, supply chain disruptions and lack of seamless communication between key players further exacerbate the issue, resulting in delayed deliveries, compromised drug quality, and an increase in health risks due to counterfeit medications. These challenges have contributed to drug resistance and improper medication usage in various regions, particularly in developing nations.  The Solution  PharmaTrack provides a transparent, trustless, and tamper-proof supply chain management system for pharmaceutical products. By utilizing blockchain technology, it eliminates opacity and enhances accountability across manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. Unlike traditional systems that are vulnerable to fraud, PharmaTrack enables seamless verification and traceability of each pharmaceutical product from its origin to the end-user.
